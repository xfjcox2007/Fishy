# Fishy
The player can use the arrow key to control the player fish. Then it can move left, right, up or down to eat other fish or avoid other fish.

The player fish is able to eat a fish which has a smaller radius and then grow. Besides, the player fish should avoid to touch the larger fish. If it tries to eat a larger one, the game will stop.

Finally, if the player fish is the biggest fish in the canvas, the game will also stop.

As the game stops, the “game over” will show up on the canvas.
